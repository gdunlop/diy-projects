### Garden room project

The first project covered in this blog is this timber framed insulated garden room I built in 2017.

This is the finished article in 2020:

The footprint is around 3.7m by 4.9m (12' x 16') and maximum height is 2.4m to comply with planning rules in force at the time.

I bought a job lot of windows several years earlier for around £400, then managed to sell one of these for £500. The profit from this was enough to buy the timber patio doors for £80.
