With the front wall fixed and vertical meant it was easy to build the side section. This included an opening for a smaller top hung window.

If you look carefully you'll see the left end of the front wall has an additional vertical stud fixed in the corner so the side stud wall can be fixed securely to it. The door frame is in position but not secured at this point.

The rear wall was easy as there were no openings required and relatively little cutting. I made it in two separate sections so it was easier to handle.

This is the frame nearing completion.
